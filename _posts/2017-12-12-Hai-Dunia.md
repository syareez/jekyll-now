Hai Dunia is a direct translation , that is acceptable, from English to Malay.

Alright, I've known that Github provides free static web hosting ,but honeslty I didnt know that setting up a blog on Github Pages is possible.

What you are looking now is a site that currently running on Jek.. jekyll.. Jekyll, yeah Jekyll.
Jekyll is a 'software' that transform plain texts into static websites and blogs , that is what they claimed on their website.
[Jekyll Website](https://jekyllrb.com/) It is written in Ruby, a programming language that I am not familiar with

To make things simpler, I found out that Jekyll could be deployed easily by forking a repository !
[Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) ah thats what I like about Open Source Community :)

**What are you going to do with this blog anyway?**
I have planned to showcase my projects and maybe articles that unnecessarily related to programming. Treat it as a random blog site.
